    "# Machine Learning Challenge Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This series of notebooks aims to give an example pipeline for a machine learning challenge. It involves a number of notebooks, and the key parts of the pipeline are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw data to machine learning friendly format\n",
    "- Exploration and verification of converted data\n",
    "- Model training and development\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "After a viewing of the notebook, hopefully the reader will be more comfortable with implementing an ML pipeline, and can use examples found in their own implementations of a Machine Learning challenge for the community of practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, some discussion around technologies, machine learning concepts, and pipeline challenges can be found"
