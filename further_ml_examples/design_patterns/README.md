# Machine Learning Design Patterns

This directory contains example code demonstrating the concepts from the book [Machine Learning Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-design/9781098115777/) by Lakshmanan et. al. and also based on the example code associated with the book available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ml-design-patterns).

The code in the repository accompanying the book is heavily tied to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), due to the creation by those working for GCP at the time. The example in this directory attempt to present the same design patterns in a more platform agnostic way, using data and problems from Weather and Climate Science.
